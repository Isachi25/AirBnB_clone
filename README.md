## 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

This Python console project aims to provide me with a comprehensive learning experience and skills as a developer.
The project covers essential topics, including;
* Creating a Python package
* Implementing a command interpreter using the cmd module
* Unit testing in large projects
* Serialization and deserialization
* JSON file handling
* Datetime management, UUIDs, and advanced function argument handling with *args and **kwargs.

What is a command interpreter
* It is a system software that understands and executes commands that are entered interactively by a human or from an another program.

How to start a command interpreter
* Clone the repository to your local machine
* Navigate to the project directory
* Run the command interpreter e.g python console.py

How to use a commandline interpreter
* Once the command interpreter is running, you can enter commands and interact with the console.
* The interpreter supports various functionalities, including Python package creation, unit testing, serialization, and more.
Examples include;
1. Creating a python package:
create_package mypackage

2. Run unit tests:
run_tests

3. Serialize and Desirialize a class:
serialize MyClass
deserialize MyClass

4. Read and write a JSON file:
write_json data.json {"key": "value"}
read_json data.json

5. Generate and Display a UUID:
generate_uuid

6. Function with named arguments
named_args_function --arg1 value1 --arg2 value2
